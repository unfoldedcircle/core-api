    ## Overview

    The Remote Two WebSocket Dock-API allows you to interact with the Unfolded Circle smart charging dock and take
    full control of its features.  

    ## 🚧 Missing Features
    
    **This API is a beta version and does not yet contain all functionality.**
    
    Planned features:
    
    - Static network settings for WiFi and ethernet.
    - Additional event messages for a multi-remote setup, e.g. IR learning started.
    
    ## API Versioning
    
    The API is versioned according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).  
    The initial public release will be `1.0.0` once it is considered stable enough.
    
    **Any major version zero (`0.y.z`) is for initial development and may change at any time!**  
    I.e. backward compatibility for minor releases is not yet established, anything MAY change at any time!

    ## WebSocket Connection
    
    - A client must authenticate itself after opening a connection to use all defined request messages.  
      Only the following messages can be used without authentication:
      - `get_sysinfo`
    - The dock supports a maximum af 5 concurrent WebSocket connections.
    
    ### Authentication

    The dock will send the `auth_required` message right after the connection is established.

    - The client must reply with the `auth` message containing the access token.

      - All other messages requiring authentication will be ignored, until the client successfully authenticates itself.
      - The dock will close the connection after a timeout.

    - The dock replies with the `authentication` event including the result code of the authentication:

      - `200`: authentication succeeded, API can be used.
      - `401`: invalid authentication and the connection will be closed.

      description: |
        The following system commands can be executed:
        
        - `ir_receive_on`: Enables IR learning.  
           - Learned codes are broadcasted with the `ir_receive` event message.
           - Learning mode status can be retrieved with the `get_sysinfo` request.
           - While learning mode is activated, no IR codes can be transmitted.
        - `ir_receive_off`: Stops IR learning.
        - `remote_charged`: Set status LED to normal operation (LED off)
        - `remote_lowbattery`: Set status LED to low battery mode (blink twice every 4 seconds).
        - `remote_normal`: Set status LED to normal operation (LED off, turn on when charging).
        - `identify`: Docking station identification, blink status LED green, amber, blue and red.
        - `reboot`: Reboot the device.
        - `reset`: Factory reset the device.
          - ❗️ All configuration data is erased and the device is put in setup mode.
        
        The server will respond with a `result` message and a status code of the request.
        
        ❗️ For `reboot` and `reset` commands there might be no response message. The dock will reboot after the command is processed.

      payload:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/systemInfoMsg'
    ir_send:
      summary: 🧪 Send an IR code or continue repeating a previous code.
      description: |
        Send an IR code on the given output(s), either in Unfolded Circle or PRONTO HEX format.

        - If multiple outputs are specified, the IR signal is transmitted in parallel on the given outputs.
        - Only one IR code can be transmitted at the same time.  
          It is not possible to send different codes on individual outputs at the same time.
        - IR transmission is blocked while the device is in learning mode.

        The IR transmission begins after the full message has been received, parsed and validated.
        Depending on the state of the IR device, different actions are taken:
        
        - Device is idle: a single code is transmitted and status code `200` returned after completion.
        - Transmitting the same IR code with the `repeat` field set: return status code `202` and continue repeating
          the IR code.
        - Transmitting another IR code: return error code `429`.

        See _Result codes_ below for all status codes.

        ### Continuous IR repeat
        This feature allows to repeat an IR signal autonomously by the dock for a specified number of times.

        The repeated IR signal is usually a special IR command to tell the receiving device, that a button on a remote
        control is hold for a longer time. Depending on the device, a repeat signal can either simply execute the same
        action as if someone would rapidly press the same button, or it can adjust the command to a different function.
        One common example is to progressively increase the volume steps, e.g. start slowly with 0.1 dBA steps, then
        after a short time increase to 0.5 or 1 dBA steps.  
        Please note that not all devices or IR formats / commands support this feature. This is manufacturer specific.

        The continuous IR repeat feature is activated with the optional `repeat` field in the `ir_send` command.
        - The IR repeat signal will automatically be sent the number of times specified in the repeat field.
        - If the next `ir_send` request contains the same `command` value, the repeat count will be reset and therefore
          the repeat signal prolonged.
        - An `ir_stop` request will stop the remaining repeat commands.
        - Depending on the IR `format`, a repeat value might be already part of the `code`.
          - ⚠️ The `repeat` value will override the embedded repeat information.
          - See _IR formats_ below.

        If not specified (or set to zero):
        - The provided `code` is sent as is, with the contained repeat information (depending on IR format).
        - Continuous IR repeat is not activated:
          - every `ir_send` command will send the full IR command.
          - ⚠️ the `ir_stop` command will have no effect!

        ### IR formats
        - `pronto`: PRONTO HEX format:
          - The PRONTO HEX format does not include a dedicated repeat count field, but an optional 2nd burst
            pair sequence used for repeats.
            - The third number in the PRONTO code specifies the number of burst pairs in the 1st sequence.
            - The fourth number in the PRONTO code specifies the number of burst pairs in the 2nd sequence.
            - If the fourth number is 0, then there's no repeat sequence.
            - Note that either sequence is optional. Also there might be both sequences defined, or only the
              1st or 2nd one.
          - If the `repeat` field is set (> 0), the 2nd burst pair sequence of the PRONTO code is repeated.
            - If the PRONTO code doesn't contain a 2nd burst pair sequence, then the repeat value is ignored.
        - `hex`: Unfolded Circle format:
          - The repeat count is part of the code and might be required for certain protocols.
            - E.g. Sony needs to send the same command two or three times so it's recognized as a single
              command by a device.
          - If the `repeat` field is set (> 0), this will override the repeat count in `code`!
          - The actual emitted IR repeat signal depends on the IR protocols.
            - E.g. Denon will simply repeat the full command, whereas LG has a mandatory repeat-specific code
              sent after the command. This is all handled by the dock firmware, when sending the IR code.


        ### Result codes
        - `200`: IR command has been sent. Either a single command, or after an IR repeat has finished.
        - `202`: IR repeat command accepted.
        - `400`: Cannot send command: invalid data or format.
        - `429`: Cannot send command: last IR command is still being sent.
        - `503`: IR sending not possible because learning is active.
