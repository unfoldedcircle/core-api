    ## Overview

    The Remote Two WebSocket Dock-API allows you to interact with the Unfolded Circle smart charging dock and take
    full control of its features.  

    ## 🚧 Missing Features
    
    **This API is a beta version and does not yet contain all functionality.**
    
    Planned features:
    
    - Static network settings for WiFi and ethernet.
    - Additional event messages for a multi-remote setup, e.g. IR learning started.
    
    ## API Versioning
    
    The API is versioned according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).  
    The initial public release will be `1.0.0` once it is considered stable enough.
    
    **Any major version zero (`0.y.z`) is for initial development and may change at any time!**  
    I.e. backward compatibility for minor releases is not yet established, anything MAY change at any time!

    ## WebSocket Connection
    
    - A client must authenticate itself after opening a connection to use all defined request messages.  
      Only the following messages can be used without authentication:
      - `get_sysinfo`
    - The dock supports a maximum af 5 concurrent WebSocket connections.
    
    ### Authentication

    The dock will send the `auth_required` message right after the connection is established.

    - The client must reply with the `auth` message containing the access token.

      - All other messages requiring authentication will be ignored, until the client successfully authenticates itself.
      - The dock will close the connection after a timeout.

    - The dock replies with the `authentication` event including the result code of the authentication:

      - `200`: authentication succeeded, API can be used.
      - `401`: invalid authentication and the connection will be closed.

        ❗️ For `reboot` and `reset` commands there might be no response message. The dock will reboot after the command is processed.
