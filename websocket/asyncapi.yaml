    ## Overview

    The Remote Two WebSockets Core-API allows you to interact with the Unfolded Circle remote-core application and take
    full control of its features.
    
    The remote-core application acts as server. Whenever the remote enters standby it may choose to disconnect client
    connections.
    
    The focus of the Core-API is to provide all functionality for the UI application and the web-configurator.  
    It may also be used by other external systems and integration drivers, if specific configuration or interaction
    features are required, which are not present in the Integration API.

    ## 🚧 Missing Features
    
    **This API is a preview version and does not yet contain all functionality.**
    
    The following features will be continuously added (in no particular order):
    
    - Matching features of the REST Core-API (except file up & download):
      - Activity management    
      - Infrared code management
    - Static network configuration
    
    Please check the [core-api GitHub issues](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/core-api/issues) for the current state. 
    
    ## API Versioning
    
    The API is versioned according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).  
    The initial public release will be `1.0.0` once it is considered stable enough with some initial integration
    implementations and developer examples.
    
    **Any major version zero (`0.y.z`) is for initial development and may change at any time!**  
    I.e. backward compatibility for minor releases is not yet established, anything MAY change at any time!
    We try avoiding it, but it might still happen...

    ## WebSocket Connection
    
    ### Authentication

    Interaction with the API requires an API-key, user account or a session cookie (see login operation in the
    REST Core-API).
    
    If the session cookie is sent with the WebSocket upgrade request, the connection is automatically authenticated.
    This is recommended when using a web browser as client.

    #### Basic authentication
    
    A user account can be used with [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
    in the WebSocket upgrade.
    
    - Header name: `Authentication`.
    - Value: `Basic ` + _base64 encoded value of ${username}:${password}_
    
    #### API-key authentication

    If the session based login is not possible or the client needs to use an API-key, then the preferred way to
    establish an authenticated WebSocket connection is to provide the API-key in the header of the WebSocket
    connection.

    - Header name: `API-KEY`.
    - Value: _API key_
    
    API keys can be created with the REST API and the `auth/api_keys` endpoints.

    #### Message based authentication 

    If the client cannot provide the API-key in the connection setup (e.g. a web browser), the server will send the
    `auth_required` message right after the connection is established.

    - The client must reply with the `auth` message containing the API-key.

      - All other messages will be ignored, until the client successfully authenticates itself.
      - The server will close an unauthenticated connection after a timeout of 15 seconds.

    - The server replies with the `authentication` event including the result code of the authentication.

      - `200`: authentication succeeded, API can be used.
      - `401`: invalid authentication and the connection will be closed.

        `503 service unavailable` is returned. 
        It is recommended to perform the update while the remote is charging in the docking station.

        The progress of the system update can be retrieved with the `get_system_update_progress` message, or by 
        listening to the `software_update` event messages.

        If the system update hasn't been downloaded yet (`download` state is `PENDING` or `ERROR`), this operation will only
        start the download and return `state: DOWNLOAD`. Once successfully downloaded, it can be installed by this
        message again.

        Start device discovery over Bluetooth and mDNS. Bluetooth or network discovery can be disabled with a query
        parameter. By default the discovery automatically stops after 30 seconds. Use the `get_dock_discovery_status`
        status request to check on discovered devices or `stop_dock_discovery` to stop discovery.

        By default only new network devices are returned. If a dock is already configured it will be omitted from the
        results, unless the query parameter `new=false` is set. Docks with Bluetooth enabled are always returned, since
        this usually means that the dock needs to be re-configured.

        - Emits the WebSocket event `dock_discovery` with `event_type: START` when discovery starts.
        - For each discovered device the WebSocket event `dock_discovery` with `event_type: DISCOVER` is emitted.

        - If there's already a setup process running for the given dock id, status code `409` is returned.
        - Emits the WebSocket event `dock_setup_change` with `event_type: START` when this operation returns `201`.

        Start setup from dock discovery:
        - The required request data can be obtained from the `/api/docks/discover` endpoints when searching for docking
          stations over Bluetooth or Ethernet. Simply provide the returned `DockDiscovery` data object (which is a super
          set of the required data to start a setup process).
        - The returned `id` in the `DockSetupInfo` response will be the identifier for the next `PUT /docks/setup/:id`
          call to provide additional data.

        Manual setup:
        - A dock identifier will automatically be created and returned in `DockSetupInfo`.
        - The dock must be reachable on the network with the provided `custom_ws_url` and optional `token`. Otherwise,
          status code `503` is returned.
        - The setup process is automatically started after a successful POST request, no call to `PUT /docks/setup/:id`
          is required.

        Response status codes:
        - `201`: setup process successfully started. Use `GET /docks/setup/:id` to poll for status updates, or listen to
           WebSocket `dock_setup_change` event messages.
        - `400`: invalid data in request body.
        - `409`: a setup process is already running. Either wait until finished, or abort it.
        - `503`: service not available to setup docking station.  
           E.g. Bluetooth is disabled and therefore the docking station cannot be setup over Bluetooth. Either enable
           Bluetooth or setup the dock over Ethernet.

        - This operation immediately starts the driver communication and setup process.
        - There may only be one active setup process per driver, otherwise status code `409` is returned.

        The returned `id` in the `IntegrationSetupInfo` response will be the identifier for the further setup operations
        with the `set_integration_user_data` and `stop_integration_setup` requests. Once the setup process is
        successfully finished, an integration instance is created. A setup process can be simple and fully automatic,
        but may also require user interaction and further communication with the `set_integration_user_data` message.

        Emits the WebSocket event `integration_setup_change` with `event_type: START`.

        Request body:
        - `name`: optional integration name. If not specified the name of the integration driver is used.
        - `setup_data`: optional driver setting values corresponding to the driver's `setup_data_schema` object.

        Response status codes:
        - `400`: invalid data in request body.
        - `404`: specified `driver_id` in request body does not exist.
        - `409`: a setup process for the given `driver_id` already exists. Either continue or abort existing process.
        - `422`: the setup process cannot be used: either the integration is already configured or doesn't allow to be
                 set up again.  
                 ⚠️ At the moment the setup process is only implemented for new integration setups. This will be extended
                    to re-run the setup process of an already configured integration.

          or service.
        - `confirm`: response to the user action `confirmation`. Set to `true` if the user had to perform an action like
          pressing a button on a device and then confirms the action with continuing the setup process.  
          The `false` value is prepared for yes / no choices.

        Integration driver model.
        
        A driver represents the communication aspect of an integration. E.g. how one can connect to it
        and which API version it supports.
        
        One driver can provide multiple `Integration` instances. In the integration API they are
        referred to as `multi-device integrations` and use the optional `device_id` property where
        required. If a driver only provides a single instance, which is usually the default use case,
        then the `device_id` is not used (or set to the default value `main`).
