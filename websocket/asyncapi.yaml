    ## Overview

    The Remote Two WebSockets Core-API allows you to interact with the Unfolded Circle remote-core application and take
    full control of its features.
    
    The remote-core application acts as server. Whenever the remote enters standby it may choose to disconnect client
    connections.
    
    The focus of the Core-API is to provide all functionality for the UI application and the web-configurator.  
    It may also be used by other external systems and integration drivers, if specific configuration or interaction
    features are required, which are not present in the Integration API.

    ## 🚧 Missing Features
    
    **This API is a preview version and does not yet contain all functionality.**
    
    The following features will be continuously added:
    
    - Software update checks, download & installation
    - Integration setup flow
    - Docking station integration
    - Infrared code management
    - Activity management    
    
    ## API Versioning
    
    The API is versioned according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).  
    The initial public release will be `1.0.0` once it is considered stable enough with some initial integration
    implementations and developer examples.
    
    **Any major version zero (`0.y.z`) is for initial development and may change at any time!**  
    I.e. backward compatibility for minor releases is not yet established, anything MAY change at any time!

    ## WebSocket Connection
    
    ### Authentication

    Interaction with the API requires an API-key or a session cookie (see login operation in REST Core-API).
    
    If the session cookie is sent with the WebSocket upgrade request, the connection is automatically authenticated.

    #### API-key authentication

    If the session based login is not possible or the client needs to use an API-key, then the preferred way to
    establish an authenticated WebSocket connection is to provide the API-key in the header of the WebSocket
    connection.

    Header name: `API-KEY`.

    #### Message based authentication 

    If the client cannot provide the API-key in the connection setup (e.g. a web browser), the server will send the
    `auth_required` message right after the connection is established.

    - The client must reply with the `auth` message containing the API-key.

      - All other messages will be ignored, until the client successfully authenticates itself.
      - The server will close the connection after a timeout.

    - The server replies with the `authentication` event including the result code of the authentication.

      - `200`: authentication succeeded, API can be used.
      - `401`: invalid authentication and the connection will be closed.

        Integration driver model.
        
        A driver represents the communication aspect of an integration. E.g. how one can connect to it
        and which API version it supports.
        
        One driver can provide multiple `Integration` instances. In the integration API they are
        referred to as `multi-device integrations` and use the optional `device_id` property where
        required. If a driver only provides a single instance, which is usually the default use case,
        then the `device_id` is not used (or set to the default value `main`).
