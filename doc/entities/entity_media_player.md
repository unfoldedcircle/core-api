### Events

The `entity_change` event must be emitted by the integration driver if the state or an attribute of the media player
changes.

The following attributes are supported:

| Attribute              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |

At least one attribute must be specified in the `entity_change` message. If the entity `state` and another attribute
changed at the same time, for example if a new track starts playing, they may both be included in the same message.
It's also valid to always send every attribute.

#### Media types

The `media_type` attribute specifies the media being played:

- `MUSIC`
- `RADIO`
- `TVSHOW`
- `MOVIE`
- `VIDEO`

The integration may return other values, but the UI will most likely handle them as an "unknown media". 

#### Media images

- Supported image formats: jpg and png.
- The album art image can either be provided as a single image or as three matching image sizes.
  - Images will automatically be resized to the required sizes.  
    Either from the single image in `media_image_url` or from the individual sizes.
  - Images too large in pixel or file size will be rejected due to resource constraints on the remote.
- Preferred image sizes in pixel:
  - Large, for full screen album art: 420 x 420
  - Medium: 100 x 100
  - Small, for thumbnails: 60 x 60
