# Integration Drivers

Since we are providing an API and not an SDK for a specific programming language, one can develop external integrations
in any language which is capable running a WebSockets server and handling JSON data.

The downside of an API is that more low-level coding is required. In our case this involves running a WebSocket server,
handling the connections from the Remote device, and parsing the JSON payload in the WebSocket text messages.
However, once this is done, the required API message interactions are rather simple to handle.

See examples below for integration libraries and existing open source integrations.

## WebSocket Integration API

The Unfolded Circle WebSocket Integration-API allows writing device integration drivers for the Unfolded Circle Remotes.

The API specification is defined with [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) in YAML format.
The WebSocket communication is using text messages with JSON payload.
