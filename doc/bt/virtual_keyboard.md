# Virtual BLE Keyboard

The virtual keyboard defines the following HID report descriptors:

- [Regular keycodes (Keyboard Keypad Page (0x07))](hid_keycodes.md)
- [Consumer codes (Consumer Page (0x0C))](hid_consumer.md)
- [System Controls (Generic Desktop Page (0x01))](hid_system_controls.md)

The upper-case `Key name` in the above usage tables is used for the remote-entity commands.
