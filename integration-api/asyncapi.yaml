    Simple integrations with static entities don't need to implement all messages.  
    **All required messages are tagged with the 🍕 emoji.**
    
    ## Overview

    The Remote Two WebSocket integrations API allows writing device integrations for the Unfolded Circle Remote Two and
    former YIO remote.  
    At the moment only user integrations running on an external host are supported.
    
    The integration driver acts as server and the Remote Two as client. The remote connects to the integration when an
    integration instance is configured. Whenever the remote enters standby it may choose to disconnect and connect again
    after wakeup.
    
    The goal of the integration API is to cover simple static drivers like controlling GPIOs on a Raspberry Pi, up to
    integrating existing home automation hubs like Home Assistant, Homey, ioBroker, openHAB etc.  
    The focus of the integration API is on entity integration, not on controlling or configuring the Remote Two. Please
    refer to the core-API for other functionality: <https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/core-api>

    ## API Versioning
    
    The API is versioned according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).  
    The initial public release will be `1.0.0` once it is considered stable enough with some initial integration
    implementations and developer examples.
    
    **Any major version zero (`0.y.z`) is for initial development and may change at any time!**  
    I.e. backward compatibility for minor releases is not yet established, anything MAY change at any time!

      description: |
        The authentication result is provided in the `code` attribute:
        - `200`: success, API can be used and message requests are accepted.
        - `401`: authentication failed, the provided token is not valid.  
          The Remote Two will close the connection. The driver should also close the connection after sending this
          response.
        
        If the driver doesn't support or require authentication, it still needs to send the `authentication` message
        with `code: 200` and `req_id: 0` after the WebSocket connection has been established by the Remote Two.
        
        It's recommended to send the optional driver version object in the the msg_data payload to avoid eventual
        additional message exchanges.

    setup_driver:
      summary: 🧪 Start driver setup.
      description: |
        If a driver includes a `setup_data_schema` object in its driver metadata, it enables the dynamic driver setup
        process. The setup process can be a simple "start-confirm-done" between the Remote Two and the integration
        driver, or a fully dynamic, multi-step process with user interactions, where the user has to provide additional
        data or select different options.
        
        The `reconfigure` flag indicates if the user wants to reconfigure an already configured driver in the Remote.
        It's up to the driver on how to handle a reconfiguration request and run a different logic. For example, this
        allows to show an options screen to change certain values, or present the option to modify, add or delete
        provided device entities.

        After confirming the `setup_driver` request, the integration driver has to send `driver_setup_change` events:
        
        - `event_type: SETUP` with `state: SETUP` is a progress event to keep the process running, see below.
        - `event_type: SETUP` with `state: WAIT_USER_ACTION` can be sent to the Remote Two to request a user
          interaction: either a confirmation to press next to continue the process, or input values.
        - `event_type: STOP` with `event: OK` finishes the setup process and the Remote Two creates an integration instance.
        - `event_type: STOP` with `event: ERROR` aborts the setup process.

        ⚠️ If the setup process takes more than a few seconds, the integration should send `driver_setup_change` events
        with `state: SETUP` to the Remote Two to show a setup progress to the user and prevent an inactivity timeout.  
        Default setup timeouts:
        - Setup progress (watchdog): 60 seconds. If no setup message is received within that time, the setup process
          is aborted.
        - User action timeout: 3 minutes. If there's no user response within that time, the setup process is aborted.
        - Overall setup timeout: 5 minutes. The setup process is automatically aborted if it is still running after
          that time.

        If no setup is needed, but the integration driver requires to show additional information to the user before
        the integration is setup (e.g. terms & conditions, further help information or web links, etc.), it can define
        an "information settings page" with text labels in `setup_data_schema` without any input fields. In this case
        the integration simply has to respond with a `driver_setup_change` event message with
        `event_type: STOP` and `state: OK` after confirming the `setup_driver` request message.

        - `confirm`: response to the user action `confirmation`. Set to `true` if the user had to perform an action like
          pressing a button on a device and then confirms the action with continuing the setup process.

        This message is sent by the Remote Two if a previously configured entity is no longer used and therefore no
        longer interested in entity updates. If the integration driver keeps sending events for the unsubscribed
        entities then they are simply discarded.

        Request the configured entities in the Remote Two originating from this integration. These are all the entities
        which are being used in the Remote Two and assigned in a profile.
        
        This allows the driver e.g. to optimize its device communication and only consider actively used entities.  
        Another option for the driver to be notified about used entities is through the `subscribe_events` requests.

    get_entity_states:
      summary: 🚀 🍕 Get the current state of the configured entities.
      description: |
        Called by the Remote Two when it needs to synchronize the dynamic entity attributes, e.g. after connection setup
        or waking up from standby.
        
        The integration should only send the state of the configured entities to reduce communication overhead,
        especially if there are many available entities, from which only a few are getting configured on the remote.  
        Any additional data will be ignored.
        
        Furthermore, the integration driver is free to decide which entity states it wants to send back. It's even
        advisable to use dirty flags in the integration driver if there are a lot of entities, and only return the
        changed data.
        
        ⚠️ Future change announcement: this request will be enhanced with a `force` flag (or the like) to signal that
        all entity states are required, and no data should be suppressed. This will happen for example after the
        remote is restarted.

    entity_command:

      description: |
        Instruct the integration driver to execute a command like "turn on" or "change temperature". 
        Optional command data like temperature value or channel number can be provided in the `params` array.
        The parameter objects are described in the entity feature definitions.
        
        The `result` response is to acknowledge the command and to return any immediate failures in case the driver
        already knows it's unable to perform the command due to invalid data, device communication issues etc.
        
        After successfully executing a command, the Remote Two expects an `entity_change` event with the updated feature 
        value(s).

      description: |
        Common definition of an entity. Concrete entities are: `cover`, `button`, `climate`, `light`, `media_player`,
        `sensor`, `switch`. 
        
        The `entity_type` value acts as discriminator for the entity type, which defines the supported features and
        options of an entity.  
        E.g. a simple `button` entity supports on / off, whereas a `cover` entity can be a simple window cover with only
        the ability to open / close, or a venetian blind with position and tilting features.  
        See [polymorphism support in AsyncAPI specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.2.0#schemaComposition)

        device, reset something etc.
        
        A button is stateless. To represent something that can be turned on and off, then the `switch` entity should be
        used.

        whenever possible, because the Remote Two either has to assume the current state, or the UI needs to ask the
        user for the current state.
