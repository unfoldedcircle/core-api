  description: "The Unfolded Circle Remote Two REST API allows to configure the remote and manage custom resource files.\nFurthermore, API-keys for the WebSocket & REST APIs can be created.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Remote Two WebSockets Core-API allows you to interact with the Unfolded Circle remote-core application and take\nfull control of its features.\n\nThe focus of the Core-API is to provide all functionality for the UI application and the web-configurator.  \nIt may also be used by other external systems and integration drivers, if specific configuration or interaction\nfeatures are required, which are not present in the Integration API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAll API endpoints besides `/api/pub` are secured. Available authentication methods are Basic Auth for every request\nand cookie based session login with the `/api/pub/login` endpoint.\n\n## \U0001F6A7 Missing Features\n\n**This API is a preview version and does not yet contain all functionality.**\n\nThe following features will be continuously added (in no particular order):\n\n- Upload of custom certificate\n- Static network configuration\n\nPlease check the [core-api GitHub issues](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/core-api/issues) for the current state. \n\n## API Versioning\n\nThe API is versioned according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).  \nThe initial public release will be `1.0.0` once it is considered stable enough with some initial integration\nimplementations and developer examples.\n\n**Any major version zero (`0.y.z`) is for initial development and may change at any time!**  \nI.e. backward compatibility for minor releases is not yet established, anything MAY change at any time!\nWe try avoiding it, but it might still happen...\n"

        The returned API key in `api_key` is only visible in this response. Afterwards it cannot be retrieved anymore!

        The newly created API key is usually not yet enabled for use and must first be approved by the user on the remote.

        The required scopes must be provided. They let you specify what exactly a client needs to access.
        When the access token request is displayed to the remote user for approval, the requested scopes will be
        displayed to them.

        An error is returned if an API key already exists for the provided `name`. To issue a new API key for the same
        name, the old token needs to be revoked first.

        External systems are handled with the R2 integrations. Before an access token for such a system can be provided,
        the corresponding system needs to be registered.

        _TODO: reference to WebSocket API for integration registration._

        If the expected system name is not returned by this call, any operations on that system name will fail:
        `/auth/external/{system}`.
        Therefore, it's advisable to either call this method first or react on the 404 error while providing or updating an
        external system token, to inform the client user, that the integration is not available on the remote.

      summary: Provide an access token of an external system.
      description: |
        An access token is usually required to connect to external systems like Home Assistant.
        This method allows the external system to automatically provide the access token for the corresponding R2
        integration instead of forcing the user to type it in. If the token name already exists for the given system,
        error `422` is returned.
        Use the put method to update an existing token.

        The format of the access token depends on the external system and the involved R2 integration.
        It could be a UUID, a JWT or any other representation required for the integration to communicate with the
        external system.

        The `system` parameter is determined by the registered R2 integration. Only registered system name identifiers are
        valid, otherwise error `404` will be returned.
        E.g. a "FooBar" integration might register the system identifier name "foobar".
        Use the `GET /auth/external` method the retrieve the registered systems.

        Start a new setup process for the given integration driver and provided setup data.

        - This operation immediately starts the driver communication and setup process.
        - There may only be one active setup process per driver, otherwise status code `409` is returned.

        The returned `id` in the `IntegrationSetupInfo` response will be the identifier for the further setup operations
        with the `/intg/setup/:driver_id` endpoints. Once the setup process is successfully finished, an integration instance is
        created. A setup process can be simple and fully automatic, but may also require user interaction and further
        communication with the `/intg/setup/:driver_id` endpoint.

        Emits the WebSocket event `integration_setup_change` with `event_type: START`.

        Request body:
        - `name`: optional integration name. If not specified the name of the integration driver is used.
        - `setup_data`: optional driver setting values corresponding to the driver's `setup_data_schema` object.

        Response status codes:
        - `400`: invalid data in request body.
        - `404`: specified `driver_id` in request body does not exist.
        - `409`: a setup process for the given `driver_id` already exists. Either continue or abort existing process.
        - `422`: the setup process cannot be used: either the integration is already configured or doesn't allow to be
                 set up again.  
                 ⚠️ At the moment the setup process is only implemented for new integration setups. This will be extended
                    to re-run the setup process of an already configured integration.

      summary: "\U0001F477 Manually register a new integration driver."
      description: |
        A driver provides the connection parameters and optional setup configuration for an integration driver.

        Registering a driver requires that the driver is running and responding to requests on the given URL. The driver
        details will be fetched and stored in the Remote.

        Depending on the driver capabilities it either provides a single access point to the provided entities, or exposes
        multiple devices, each with its own unique set of entities. The former could for example be used to provide GPIO
        access of a Raspberry Pi or gather all supported devices it is able to interact with (e.g. network sensors, light
        switches etc.). The more capable multi-device mode is suited to bridge home automation hubs where multiple
        instances should be supported.

        Once a driver is registered, one or more integration instances must be configured to interact with the driver.  
        For simple integration drivers there's a 1:1 relationship between an instance and driver. For multi-device drivers, 
        each device corresponds to an integration instance.

        It is recommended to manually set a unique and human-readable driver identifier in `driver_id`. Otherwise a UUID
        will be assigned. The `driver_id` is required for all further interactions with the driver, like creating a runtime
        instance to connect to the driver and fetch available entities.

        Update connection settings of an external integration driver if the URL or access token has changed. The new
        settings are immediately applied and the driver communication verified. This might take a few seconds.  
        The driver's own optional configuration settings cannot be applied with this operation and are configured during
        the setup process, or through the integration instance.

        - Only external integration drivers can be modified. Otherwise `400` (Bad Request) is returned.
        - Connection settings are tested and applied against the driver.
          - `503` (Service Unavailable) is returned if the driver communication fails.
          - If the driver is not active, the settings are only applied and not tested! This is for development use only.
        - See request description on how to update or remove an existing setting.

        Create a new entity of type `activity`. An activity entity is a special internal entity without association to an
        integration driver.

        To create a new activity at least a name must be provided. The `icon`, `description` and `options.entity_ids`
        are optional and can be set later with the `PUT` update operation.

        When setting a text in a multilingual field, like name or description, the default `en` identifier should always be
        included.

        An activity can be cloned from another activity-, macro- or remote-entity identifier in `clone_from`. 
        All applicable configuration will be copied, except a new activity name must be specified. The `icon` and
        `description` fields can still be specified and will override the copied data. The `options.entity_ids` is
        not allowed when cloning data, additional entities can be added later with the `PUT` update operation.

        The `entity_ids` may be omitted when creating a new activity and specified later when updating the activity.

      summary: Create a new macro entity.
      description: |
        Create a new entity of type `macro`. An macro entity is a special internal entity without association to an
        integration driver.

        To create a new macro at least a name must be provided. The `icon`, `description` and `options.entity_ids`
        are optional and can be set later with the `PUT` update operation.

        When setting a text in a multilingual field, like name or description, the default `en` identifier should always be
        included.

        The new macro can be cloned from another macro-entity identifier in `clone_from`. All applicable configuration will
        be copied, except a new macro name must be specified. The `icon` and `description` fields can still be specified and
        will override the copied data. The `options.entity_ids` is not allowed when cloning data, additional entities
        can be added later with the `PUT` update operation.

        The `entity_ids` may be omitted when creating a new macro and specified later when updating the macro.

      summary: Bulk upload infrared codes with a CSV file.
      description: |
        Upload multiple IR codes from a CSV file into an existing code set.

        CSV file format:
        - delimiter character is `,` (comma). This can be overwritten with the query parameter `delimiter`.
        - character set: plain ASCII or UTF-8.
        - the first line must contain a header row.
        - required header columns:
          - `key`: Key / button of the IR code.
            - Valid character RegEx: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-_\.]{1,50}$`
            - Invalid characters will be replaced with an underscore.
          - `code`: IR code
          - ⚠️`key` and `code` must be lower-case, otherwise a validation error will be returned.
        - optional header column:
          - `format`: IR code format: `PRONTO` or `HEX`. Default if missing: `PRONTO`
        - order of the header columns is not relevant, additional columns will be ignored.
        - rows with an empty `key` or `code` value are ignored.
        - duplicate `key` values are not allowed.
          - The optional `overwrite` query parameter applies to existing keys only.
        - max size: 10 MB

        Minimal example:
        ```csv
        key,code
        POWER_ON,0000 006d 0000 0020 000a
        POWER_OFF,0000 006d 0000 0020 000b
        ```

        Notes:    
        - If multiple files are specified in the form-data, only the first one will be processed.
        - Header and values are automatically trimmed from leading and trailing whitespace.
        - ⚠️ In case there's an invalid record in the CSV file, all previous valid records will be added to the data set.

      summary: Send IR command.
      description: |
        Send an IR command from the specified command set or a learned / custom code on the given emitter and output port.

        ### Continuous IR repeat
        If supported by the emitter, this feature allows to repeat an IR signal autonomously by the emitting device for
        a specified number of times.

        ⚠️ Supported on the UnfoldedCircle Dock with firmware version 0.9.0 or newer. 

        The repeated IR signal is usually a special IR command to tell the receiving device, that a button on a remote
        control is hold for a longer time. Depending on the device, a repeat signal can either simply execute the same
        action as if someone would rapidly press the same button, or it can adjust the command to a different function.
        One common example is to progressively increase the volume steps, e.g. start slowly with 0.1 dBA steps, then
        after a short time increase to 0.5 or 1 dBA steps.  
        Please note that not all devices or IR formats / commands support this feature. This is manufacturer specific.

        The continuous IR repeat feature is activated with the optional `repeat` field in the request.
        - The IR repeat signal will automatically be sent the number of times specified in the repeat field.
        - If the next request contains the same IR command, the repeat count will be reset in the dock and therefore
          the repeat signal prolonged.
        - A 'PUT /ir/emitters/{emitterId}/stopsend' request will stop the remaining repeat commands.
        - Depending on the IR `format`, a repeat value might be already part of the `code`.
          - ⚠️ The `repeat` value will override the embedded repeat information.
          - See _IR formats_ below.

        If `repeat` is not specified (or set to zero):
        - The stored IR code in the `codeset_id` or provided `code` is sent as is, with the contained repeat information
          (depending on IR format).
        - Continuous IR repeat is not activated:
          - every IR send request will send the full IR command.
          - ⚠️ the 'PUT /ir/emitters/{emitterId}/stopsend' command will have no effect!

        ### IR formats
        - `PRONTO`: PRONTO HEX format:
          - The PRONTO HEX format does not include a dedicated repeat count field, but an optional 2nd burst
            pair sequence used for repeats.
            - The third number in the PRONTO code specifies the number of burst pairs in the 1st sequence.
            - The fourth number in the PRONTO code specifies the number of burst pairs in the 2nd sequence.
            - If the fourth number is 0, then there's no repeat sequence.
            - Note that either sequence is optional. Also there might be both sequences defined, or only the
              1st or 2nd one.
          - If the `repeat` field is set (> 0), the 2nd burst pair sequence of the PRONTO code is repeated.
            - If the PRONTO code doesn't contain a 2nd burst pair sequence, then the repeat value is ignored.
        - `HEX`: Unfolded Circle format:
          - The repeat count is part of the code and might be required for certain protocols.
            - E.g. Sony needs to send the same command two or three times so it's recognized as a single
              command by a device.
          - If the `repeat` field is set (> 0), this will override the repeat count in `code` (and not multiply the total
            repeat count)!
          - The actual emitted IR repeat signal depends on the IR protocols.
            - E.g. Denon will simply repeat the full command, whereas LG has a mandatory repeat-specific code
              sent after the command. This is all handled by the dock, when sending the IR code.

      summary: Create a new remote-entity with a manufacturer IR code set or an empty custom code set.
      description: |
        Create a new entity of type `remote`. An remote-entity is a special internal entity without association to an
        integration driver.

        To create a new remote at least a name must be provided. If no manufacturer infrared code set is specified in
        `options.codeset_id`, a new custom code set is automatically created for the user to manually specify or learn the
        codes.  
        The `icon` and `description` properties are optional and can be set later with the `PUT` update operation.

        When setting a text in a multilingual field, like name or description, the default `en` identifier should always be
        included.

        The new remote can be cloned from another remote-entity identifier in `clone_from`. All applicable configuration
        will be copied, except a new remote name must be specified. The `icon` and `description` fields can still be
        specified and will override the copied data. The `options.codeset_id` is not allowed when cloning data.

        - Restricted profile: intended for guests or children, who can only use the remote, but cannot change settings.

        The admin PIN is required to switch from a restricted to a normal profile. It can be defined in settings.  

        - Switching away from a restricted profile will prompt the user to enter the admin PIN.
        - Switching to a restricted profile can be done without entering the admin PIN.

        Profile request object:    
        - `profile_id` is optional and auto-generated if not specified. Otherwise it needs to be a unique profile identifier.
        - `name` is mandatory and must be unique.

        - Settings stay persisted for PATCH requests not containing the `ws` key.
        - Return and apply current system settings: send a PATCH request with an empty object: `"ws": {}".
        - The `ws` settings can only be removed with a configuration reset: `DELETE /cfg`
        - Modifying any `ws` settings requires a system reboot.

        If `check_for_updates` is enabled:
        - the device automatically checks for new updates daily. The check happens during a random time within the 
          OTA window time frame `ota_window_start` - `ota_window_end`.
        - if a new update is available, the update metadata is immediately downloaded and the firmware update file is
          scheduled to download.
        - the firmware file will only download if the remote has at least 50% battery charge.
        - if the remote is not in the dock and suspended, the remote will not automatically wake up and the check
          will be skipped.

        If `auto_update` is enabled:
        - once the firmware file is downloaded it will be automatically installed in the next OTA check window.
        - the installation will only start if the remote has at least 50% battery charge.

        OTA window fields:
        - the stored values are used if omitted. 
        - default values are set if not configured.
        - the time of day corresponds to the configured timezone.
        - for changing the update window, both start and end times are required, otherwise a default will be used.
        - if the end time is before the start time, the window will spawn over midnight, e.g. `23:00:00` - `01:00:00`.

        Optional software update channel & token:
        - the default release channel is used if not configured.
        - the stored values are used if omitted. 
        - changing the update channel is intended for closed user groups only.  
          ⚠️ High chance of breaking changes, bugs and loosing data!
        - other channels than `default` might require an access token in `channel_token`.
        - ⚠️ Changing the update channel or token requires a device restart, otherwise the automated updates will not use
             the new channel!

      description: |
        Manually create and persist a new dock configuration. This is a low-level operation without configuring and setting
        up the dock as with the `/docks/setup` endpoints! To establish a session to the dock, the connect operation must be
        called afterwards.  
        - Error `422` is returned if the given service name in `dock_id` already exists.
        - If `custom_ws_url` is not specified, the dock address is resolved through an mDNS service name lookup in `dock_id`.   
        - The `active` flag specifies if the dock will react to connection requests.
        - Non-active docks will not auto-connect and must be enabled first to be used.
        - Non-active docks won't be visible in the web-configurator.
        - If no `token` is provided the default token is used! The token is used to authenticate the WebSocket
          connection once a connection to the dock is established. To change an existing token, use the 
          `PATCH /docks/devices/:dockId` operation.
        - If `model` is provided it must be one of the known dock model identifiers: `UCD2` or `YIO1DOCK`.

        parameter. By default the discovery automatically stops after 30 seconds. Use the GET status request to check on

        By default only new network devices are returned. If a dock is already configured it will be omitted from the

        - Emits the WebSocket event `dock_discovery` with `event_type: START` when discovery starts.
        - For each discovered device the WebSocket event `dock_discovery` with `event_type: DISCOVER` is emitted.

      summary: Start setting up a new docking station.
      description: |
        Create a new setup process from a discovered dock or from a manually provided dock address.

        - If there's already a setup process running for the given dock id, status code `409` is returned.
        - Emits the WebSocket event `dock_setup_change` with `event_type: START` when this operation returns `201`.

        Start setup from dock discovery:
        - The required request data can be obtained from the `/api/docks/discover` endpoints when searching for docking
          stations over Bluetooth or Ethernet. Simply provide the returned `DockDiscovery` data object (which is a super
          set of the required data to start a setup process).
        - The returned `id` in the `DockSetupInfo` response will be the identifier for the next `PUT /docks/setup/:id`
          call to provide additional data.

        Manual setup:
        - A dock identifier will automatically be created and returned in `DockSetupInfo`.
        - The dock must be reachable on the network with the provided `custom_ws_url` and optional `token`. Otherwise,
          status code `503` is returned.
        - The setup process is automatically started after a successful POST request, no call to `PUT /docks/setup/:id`
          is required.

        Response status codes:
        - `201`: setup process successfully started. Use `GET /docks/setup/:id` to poll for status updates, or listen to
           WebSocket `dock_setup_change` event messages.
        - `400`: invalid data in request body.
        - `409`: a setup process is already running. Either wait until finished, or abort it.
        - `503`: service not available to setup docking station.  
           E.g. Bluetooth is disabled and therefore the docking station cannot be setup over Bluetooth. Either enable
           Bluetooth or setup the dock over Ethernet.

      description: |
        Export the full Remote Two device configuration. This allows to restore the configuration after a factory reset
        or to load the configuration onto another device.

        - The backup archive is only returned to the client and not stored on the device. 
        - The returned backup archive can be restored with `PUT /system/backup/restore`.
        - It is recommended to perform the backup while the remote is in the docking station.
        - Using the remote or the Core-API should be avoided while the backup is running.
        - The backup should only take a few seconds. The backup will take longer:
          - if integration drivers are busy and require more time to shutdown.
          - if many custom resources (icons, background images, etc) are present.

        ⚠️ Attention:
        - The backup archive may contain personal information and access keys to external systems.
          - The backup archive is not encrypted. Contained information can be extracted with little effort.
          - For example the long-lived access token for Home Assistant is included, if that integration has been configured.
        - All integrations and docks will be disconnected and stopped during backup.
          - They are restarted after the backup is finished. This may take several seconds until all entities are available again.
          - Restart the device, if an integration or entities are no longer working after a backup.
        - The device must have enough free disk space to create the backup archive. At least 100 MB must be free to start the backup process.

        The backup **does not include**:
        - WiFi network configuration and passwords.
        - Administrator pin.
        - Web-configurator pin.
        - Any API-keys created with the Core-API.

        Error codes:
        - `403`: forbidden, only an administrator account may create a backup.
        - `409`: conflict, a backup or restore process is already running.

        - It is highly recommended to perform the restore while the remote is in the docking station.

        ⚠️ Attention:
        - The device will not automatically restart after a system restore.
          - The device must be restarted after the restore to activate all changed settings.
          - Certain setting changes like OTA require a system restart.
        - WiFi configuration, administrator pin and web-configurator pin are not overwritten by a system restore.

        ☢️ VOIDS WARRANTY ☢️

        The `void_warranty` query parameter is required to install a custom component:
        - The user has to agree and confirm, that the warranty will be voided by installing a custom component.
        - The confirmation will be recorded in a write-once location on the device and cannot be reverted!
        - The value of the parameter must be `yes`, otherwise the installation is aborted and `401` returned. 

        Custom archive requirements:
        - TAR GZip archive (either .tgz or .tar.gz file suffix).
        - In the root of the archive, there must be a `release.json` file describing the custom version.  
          See `CustomRelease` schema for the release.json format.
        - No symlinks. They are automatically removed during the installation.
        - UI:
          - The UI binary must be named `remote-ui` in the `./bin` subdirectory.
          - All application files must be in one of the following subdirectories, other locations are not accessible at runtime:
            - `./bin`: application binary, usually only `remote-ui`.
            - `./config`: configuration data. Path is accessible with `UC_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable.
            - `./data`: application data. Path is accessible with `UC_DATA_HOME` environment variable.
        - web-configurator:
          - An `index.html` file must be in the root of the archive.

        Error response codes:
        - `400`: invalid archive, missing data in archive or included metadata cannot be read.
        - `403`: user did not agree to void warranty, or user does not have administrator rights.
        - `409`: custom component is not compatible with the current firmware.
        - `507`: insufficient storage to upload and process installation archive.

        ⚠️ Attention:
        - Installing a custom web-configurator might disconnect the current request. Use a GET request to check for the current state.
        - Installing a custom remote-ui will restart the application and the screen will go dark for a while.
        - For certain error conditions, the device might restart.

      summary: Perform system update.
      description: |
        Start a system update with the given `updateId` parameter. Use `latest` to use the latest available system update.

        The system update will be started if:
        - the system update has been downloaded already (`download` state is `DOWNLOADED`).
        - the device has at least 50% battery charge.

        If the system update is started, the response message contains `state: START`. In case there's not enough battery,
        `503 service unavailable` is returned. 
        It is recommended to perform the update while the remote is charging in the docking station.

        The progress of the system update can be retrieved with the `GET` operation, or by listening to the WebSocket 
        `software_update` event messages.

        If the system update hasn't been downloaded yet (`download` state is `PENDING` or `ERROR`), this operation will only
        start the download and return `state: DOWNLOAD`. Once successfully downloaded, it can be installed by calling this
        operation again.

        ⚠️ Download progress events are not yet implemented!

        Error codes:
        - `404`: updateId does not exist
        - `409`: download or update is already running
        - `422`: for download request: update is already downloaded

        The `entity_ids` object must be managed by the client and is persisted when updating an activity.

        - Entities can be included in `entity_ids` without being used in `sequences`.  
          This allows to edit the activity in multiple sessions without having to reselect the desired entities.
        - Every referenced entity in `sequences` must be included in `entity_ids`, otherwise the activity cannot be saved.
        - If the client removes a configured entity from the system which is included in an activity, it must make sure to
          also remove all references in the activity. See `IncludedEntity.available` property in the included entities
          object when retrieving an activity.

        A driver represents the communication aspect of an integration. E.g. how one can connect to it
        and which API version it supports.

        One driver can provide multiple `Integration` instances. In the integration API they are
        referred to as `multi-device integrations` and use the optional `device_id` property where
        required. If a driver only provides a single instance, which is usually the default use case,
        then the `device_id` is not used (or set to the default value `main`).

          all drivers. If omitted, the driver identifier returned by the driver will be used.

        The `entity_ids` object must be managed by the client and is persisted when updating a macro.

        Notes:
        - Entities can be included in `entity_ids` without being used in `sequence`.  
          This allows to edit the macro in multiple sessions without having to reselect the desired entities.
        - Every referenced entity in `sequence` must be included in `entity_ids`, otherwise the macro cannot be saved.
        - If the client removes a configured entity from the system which is included in a macro, it must make sure to also
          remove all references in the macro. See `available` property in the included entities object when retrieving a macro.
