  description: "The Unfolded Circle Remote Two REST API allows to configure the remote and manage custom resource files.\nFurthermore, API-keys for the WebSocket & REST APIs can be created.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Remote Two WebSockets Core-API allows you to interact with the Unfolded Circle remote-core application and take\nfull control of its features.\n\nThe focus of the Core-API is to provide all functionality for the UI application and the web-configurator.  \nIt may also be used by other external systems and integration drivers, if specific configuration or interaction\nfeatures are required, which are not present in the Integration API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAll API endpoints besides `/api/pub` are secured. Available authentication methods are Basic Auth for every request\nand cookie based session login with the `/api/pub/login` endpoint.\n\n## \U0001F6A7 Missing Features\n\n**This API is a preview version and does not yet contain all functionality.**\n\nThe following features will be continuously added:\n\n- Configuration import & export\n- Bulk import of custom IR datasets\n\n## API Versioning\n\nThe API is versioned according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).  \nThe initial public release will be `1.0.0` once it is considered stable enough with some initial integration\nimplementations and developer examples.\n\n**Any major version zero (`0.y.z`) is for initial development and may change at any time!**  \nI.e. backward compatibility for minor releases is not yet established, anything MAY change at any time!\n"

        The returned API key in `api_key` is only visible in this response. Afterwards it cannot be retrieved anymore!

        The newly created API key is usually not yet enabled for use and must first be approved by the user on the remote.

        The required scopes must be provided. They let you specify what exactly a client needs to access.
        When the access token request is displayed to the remote user for approval, the requested scopes will be
        displayed to them.

        An error is returned if an API key already exists for the provided `name`. To issue a new API key for the same
        name, the old token needs to be revoked first.

      description: |
        External systems are handled with the R2 integrations. Before an access token for such a system can be provided,
        the corresponding system needs to be registered.

        _TODO: reference to WebSocket API for integration registration._

        If the expected system name is not returned by this call, any operations on that system name will fail:
        `/auth/external/{system}`.
        Therefore, it's advisable to either call this method first or react on the 404 error while providing or updating an
        external system token, to inform the client user, that the integration is not available on the remote.

      summary: Provide an access token of an external system.
      description: |
        An access token is usually required to connect to external systems like Home Assistant.
        This method allows the external system to automatically provide the access token for the corresponding R2
        integration instead of forcing the user to type it in. If the token name already exists for the given system,
        error `422` is returned.
        Use the put method to update an existing token.

        The format of the access token depends on the external system and the involved R2 integration.
        It could be a UUID, a JWT or any other representation required for the integration to communicate with the
        external system.

        The `system` parameter is determined by the registered R2 integration. Only registered system name identifiers are
        valid, otherwise error `404` will be returned.
        E.g. a "FooBar" integration might register the system identifier name "foobar".
        Use the `GET /auth/external` method the retrieve the registered systems.

        Start a new setup process for the given integration driver and provided setup data.

        - This operation immediately starts the driver communication and setup process.
        - There may only be one active setup process per driver, otherwise status code `409` is returned.

        The returned `id` in the `IntegrationSetupInfo` response will be the identifier for the further setup operations
        with the `/intg/setup/:driver_id` endpoints. Once the setup process is successfully finished, an integration instance is
        created. A setup process can be simple and fully automatic, but may also require user interaction and further
        communication with the returned `/intg/setup/:driver_id` endpoint.

        Emits the WebSocket event `integration_setup_change` with `event_type: START`.

        Request body:
        - `name`: optional integration name. If not specified the name of the integration driver is used.
        - `setup_data`: optional driver setting values corresponding to the driver's `setup_data_schema` object.

        Response status codes:
        - `400`: invalid data in request body.
        - `404`: specified `driver_id` in request body does not exist.
        - `409`: a setup process for the given `driver_id` already exists. Either continue or abort existing process.
        - `422`: the setup process cannot be used: either the integration is already configured or doesn't allow to be
                 set up again.  
                 ⚠️ At the moment the setup process is only implemented for new integration setups. This will be extended
                    to re-run the setup process of an already configured integration.

      summary: "\U0001F477 Manually register a new integration driver."
      description: |
        A driver provides the connection parameters and optional setup configuration for an integration driver.

        Registering a driver requires that the driver is running and responding to requests on the given URL. The driver
        details will be fetched and stored in the Remote.

        Depending on the driver capabilities it either provides a single access point to the provided entities, or exposes
        multiple devices, each with its own unique set of entities. The former could for example be used to provide GPIO
        access of a Raspberry Pi or gather all supported devices it is able to interact with (e.g. network sensors, light
        switches etc.). The more capable multi-device mode is suited to bridge home automation hubs where multiple
        instances should be supported.

        Once a driver is registered, one or more integration instances must be configured to interact with the driver.  
        For simple integration drivers there's a 1:1 relationship between an instance and driver. For multi-device drivers, 
        each device corresponds to an integration instance.

        It is recommended to manually set a unique and human-readable driver identifier in `driver_id`. Otherwise a UUID
        will be assigned. The `driver_id` is required for all further interactions with the driver, like creating a runtime
        instance to connect to the driver and fetch available entities.

        Update connection settings of an external integration driver if the URL or access token has changed. The new
        settings are immediately applied and the driver communication verified. This might take a few seconds.  
        The driver's own optional configuration settings cannot be applied with this operation and are configured during
        the setup process, or through the integration instance.

        - Only external integration drivers can be modified. Otherwise `400` (Bad Request) is returned.
        - Connection settings are tested and applied against the driver.
          - `503` (Service Unavailable) is returned if the driver communication fails.
          - If the driver is not active, the settings are only applied and not tested! This is for development use only.
        - See request description on how to update or remove an existing setting.

        Create a new entity of type `activity`. An activity entity is a special internal entity without association to an
        integration driver.

        To create a new activity at least a name must be provided. The `icon`, `description` and `options.entity_ids`
        are optional and can be set later with the `PUT` update operation.

        When setting a text in a multilingual field, like name or description, the default `en` identifier should always be
        included.

        An activity can be cloned from another activity-, macro- or remote-entity identifier in `clone_from`. 
        All applicable configuration will be copied, except a new activity name must be specified. The `icon` and
        `description` fields can still be specified and will override the copied data. The `options.entity_ids` is
        not allowed when cloning data, additional entities can be added later with the `PUT` update operation.

        The `entity_ids` may be omitted when creating a new activity and specified later when updating the activity.

      description: |
        Create a new entity of type `macro`. An macro entity is a special internal entity without association to an
        integration driver.

        To create a new macro at least a name must be provided. The `icon`, `description` and `options.entity_ids`
        are optional and can be set later with the `PUT` update operation.

        When setting a text in a multilingual field, like name or description, the default `en` identifier should always be
        included.

        The new macro can be cloned from another macro-entity identifier in `clone_from`. All applicable configuration will
        be copied, except a new macro name must be specified. The `icon` and `description` fields can still be specified and
        will override the copied data. The `options.entity_ids` is not allowed when cloning data, additional entities
        can be added later with the `PUT` update operation.

        The `entity_ids` may be omitted when creating a new macro and specified later when updating the macro.

        automatically after the timeout, unless it hasn't been stopped with the `DELETE` operation, or a new learning

        Any learned code will immediately be sent as a WebSocket `ir_learning`event message in the `emitters` channel.
        Furthermore, the codes are stored for retrieval with the `GET` status call. There's a maximum of 16 learned
        codes per session. Any additional codes will be ignored and only sent as a WebSocket event.

        Calling this function, while learning is still active, will extend the timeout. Any previously learned codes

      summary: Create a new remote-entity with a manufacturer IR code set or an empty custom code set.
      description: |
        Create a new entity of type `remote`. An remote-entity is a special internal entity without association to an
        integration driver.

        To create a new remote at least a name must be provided. If no manufacturer infrared code set is specified in
        `options.codeset_id`, a new custom code set is automatically created for the user to manually specify or learn the
        codes.  
        The `icon` and `description` properties are optional and can be set later with the `PUT` update operation.

        When setting a text in a multilingual field, like name or description, the default `en` identifier should always be
        included.

        The new remote can be cloned from another remote-entity identifier in `clone_from`. All applicable configuration
        will be copied, except a new remote name must be specified. The `icon` and `description` fields can still be
        specified and will override the copied data. The `options.codeset_id` is not allowed when cloning data.

        Manually create and persist a new dock configuration. This is a low-level operation without configuring and setting
        up the dock as with the `/docks/setup` endpoints! To establish a session to the dock, the connect operation must be
        called afterwards.  
        - Error `422` is returned if the given service name in `dock_id` already exists.
        - If `custom_ws_url` is not specified, the dock address is resolved through an mDNS service name lookup in `dock_id`.   
        - The `active` flag specifies if the dock will react to connection requests.
        - Non-active docks will not auto-connect and must be enabled first to be used.
        - Non-active docks won't be visible in the web-configurator.
        - If no `token` is provided the default token is used! The token is used to authenticate the WebSocket
          connection once a connection to the dock is established. To change an existing token, use the 
          `PATCH /docks/devices/:dockId` operation.
        - If `model` is provided it must be one of the known dock model identifiers: `UCD2` or `YIO1DOCK`.

        - For each discovered device the WebSocket event `dock_discovery` with `event_type: DISCOVER` is emitted.

      summary: Start setting up a new docking station.
      description: |
        Create a new setup process from a discovered dock or from a manually provided dock address.

        - If there's already a setup process running for the given dock id, status code `409` is returned.
        - Emits the WebSocket event `dock_setup_change` with `event_type: START` when this operation returns `201`.

        Start setup from dock discovery:
        - The required request data can be obtained from the `/api/docks/discover` endpoints when searching for docking
          stations over Bluetooth or Ethernet. Simply provide the returned `DockDiscovery` data object (which is a super
          set of the required data to start a setup process).
        - The returned `id` in the `DockSetupInfo` response will be the identifier for the next `PUT /docks/setup/:id`
          call to provide additional data.

        Manual setup:
        - A dock identifier will automatically be created and returned in `DockSetupInfo`.
        - The dock must be reachable on the network with the provided `custom_ws_url` and optional `token`. Otherwise,
          status code `503` is returned.
        - The setup process is automatically started after a successful POST request, no call to `PUT /docks/setup/:id`
          is required.

        Response status codes:
        - `201`: setup process successfully started. Use `GET /docks/setup/:id` to poll for status updates, or listen to
           WebSocket `dock_setup_change` event messages.
        - `400`: invalid data in request body.
        - `409`: a setup process is already running. Either wait until finished, or abort it.
        - `503`: service not available to setup docking station.  
           E.g. Bluetooth is disabled and therefore the docking station cannot be setup over Bluetooth. Either enable
           Bluetooth or setup the dock over Ethernet.

        Check if there is an update available for the dock.

        This operation will use the cached update information from the software update cloud service, which runs
        periodically to check for available updates and independently from this operation.  
        The returned `update_check_enabled` flag indicates if the online update check is enabled or not.

        If `update_id` is set then an update is currently in progress and can be monitored either with listening to the
        WebSocket `dock_update_change` event messages or polling the status with the
        `GET /docks/devices/{dockId}/update/{id}` operation.

        All root properties are optional and only the provided objects are updated in the activity. Omitted objects are
        ignored and not deleted from the activity.

        The `entity_ids` object must be managed by the client and is persisted when updating an activity.

        Notes:
        - Entities can be included in `entity_ids` without being used in `sequences`.  
          This allows to edit the activity in multiple sessions without having to reselect the desired entities.
        - Every referenced entity in `sequences` must be included in `entity_ids`, otherwise the activity cannot be saved.
        - If the client removes a configured entity from the system which is included in an activity, it must make sure to
          also remove all references in the activity. See `available` property in the included entities object when retrieving
          a macro.

        Integration driver model.

        A driver represents the communication aspect of an integration. E.g. how one can connect to it
        and which API version it supports.

        One driver can provide multiple `Integration` instances. In the integration API they are
        referred to as `multi-device integrations` and use the optional `device_id` property where
        required. If a driver only provides a single instance, which is usually the default use case,
        then the `device_id` is not used (or set to the default value `main`).

        - The only required property is `driver_url` to contact the driver and fetch all driver data.
        - If the driver requires an access token, the `token` needs to be specified and optionally the authentication method
          in `auth_method`.
        - The `driver_id` identifier can be specified by the client, but it needs to be unique among
          all drivers. If omitted, the driver identifier returned by the driver will be used.  
          A manually assigned, short, human-readable identifier is recommended for better recognizability.

    MacroUpdate:
      description: |
        Dedicated request object to update an existing macro.  
        All root properties are optional and only the provided objects are updated in the macro. Omitted objects are
        ignored and not deleted from the macro.

        The `entity_ids` object must be managed by the client and is persisted when updating a macro.

        Notes:
        - Entities can be included in `entity_ids` without being used in `sequence`.  
          This allows to edit the macro in multiple sessions without having to reselect the desired entities.
        - Every referenced entity in `sequence` must be included in `entity_ids`, otherwise the macro cannot be saved.
        - If the client removes a configured entity from the system which is included in a macro, it must make sure to also
          remove all references in the macro. See `available` property in the included entities object when retrieving a macro.
